## Entries

**Slice:** 01 ‚Äì Persistence Layer
**Date:** 2025-10-12 14:30 Europe/UK
**Summary:** Implemented JSON-based save/load functionality for pet data. Pet stats are now persisted to `~/.termipet/pet.json` with automatic directory creation. Gracefully handles missing or corrupted files by returning default pet values. All stat defaults follow BEHAVIOURS.md specification (hunger: 80, happiness: 80, energy: 80, xp: 0, level: 1, cleanliness: 80, potty_level: 0).
**Tests:** All green (6/6 passed) - save_pet creates valid JSON, load_pet reads correctly, handles missing files, recovers from invalid JSON
**Suggested commit message:** "feat: implement persistence layer for pet data storage and retrieval"

---

**Slice:** 02 ‚Äì Adopt Command
**Date:** 2025-10-12 15:00 Europe/UK
**Summary:** Implemented CLI command `termipet adopt --name <NAME> --species <SPECIES>` to create and save a new pet. The command checks for existing pets and prompts for confirmation before overwriting. Displays friendly welcome message with emoji (üêæ Welcome, Kylo the dog!). Uses clap derive macros for CLI argument parsing.
**Tests:** All green (10/10 passed) - creates new pet, detects existing pet, handles overwrite confirmation, validates message format
**Suggested commit message:** "feat: add adopt command to create and name new pet"

---

**Slice:** 03 ‚Äì Status Command
**Date:** 2025-10-12 15:30 Europe/UK
**Summary:** Implemented `termipet status` command to display pet's current stats and mood. Stats are color-coded using the `colored` crate (green ‚â•70, yellow 40-69, red <40). Mood is calculated based on stat thresholds from BEHAVIOURS.md with 6 moods: Happy (üêæ), Hungry (üçñ), Sleepy (üí§), Bored (üéæ), Grumpy (üò†), Embarrassed (üí©). Gracefully handles missing pet file with helpful message. Created mood calculation module with full test coverage.
**Tests:** All green (25/25 passed) - mood calculations for all 6 moods, color coding boundaries, status display, missing file handling
**Suggested commit message:** "feat: add status command with mood calculation and color-coded display"

---

**Slice:** 04 ‚Äì Feed Command
**Date:** 2025-10-12 16:00 Europe/UK
**Summary:** Implemented `termipet feed` command to restore pet's hunger and happiness. Feeding increases hunger by +20 and happiness by +10 (both capped at 100). Special handling for full pets (hunger ‚â•95) displays "Kylo is already full!" message. Created utility module with `cap_stat()` function for boundary enforcement. Displays reaction message following BEHAVIOURS.md format: "üçñ Kylo munches happily! [Hunger +20, Happiness +10]" with color-coded stat changes. Changes are persisted automatically to pet.json.
**Tests:** All green (35/35 passed) - stat increases, capping at 100, full pet detection, stat change calculations, cap_stat boundary tests
**Suggested commit message:** "feat: add feed command to restore hunger and happiness"

---

**Slice:** 05 ‚Äì Play Command
**Date:** 2025-10-12 16:30 Europe/UK
**Summary:** Implemented `termipet play` command to play with pet, increasing happiness while consuming energy. Playing increases happiness by +15 and decreases energy by -10 (both bounded 0-100). Special handling for tired pets (energy <10) displays "Kylo is too tired to play right now." with no stat changes. Reuses existing `cap_stat()` utility from utils module for boundary enforcement. Displays playful reaction: "üéæ Kylo plays fetch and wags their tail! [Happiness +15, Energy -10]" with green for increases and red for decreases. Changes are persisted automatically to pet.json.
**Tests:** All green (40/40 passed) - happiness increases, energy decreases, tired pet prevention, stat capping, stat change calculations
**Suggested commit message:** "feat: add play command to increase happiness and consume energy"

---

**Slice:** 06 ‚Äì Walk Command
**Date:** 2025-10-12 17:00 Europe/UK
**Summary:** Implemented `termipet walk` command to restore energy and manage potty needs with probabilistic behavior. Walking increases energy by +15 (capped at 100) and has 80% chance to reduce potty_level by -50 (min 0). Added accident handling: if potty_level >80 before walk, pet has accident (cleanliness -30, happiness -15). Created `random_bool(probability)` utility function using rand crate for probabilistic pet behaviors. Three message variants based on outcome: normal walk ("üö∂ Kylo enjoyed the walk"), potty relief ("üö∂ Kylo feels relieved"), or accident ("üí© Kylo had an accident but feels better now"). Changes are persisted automatically to pet.json.
**Tests:** All green (50/50 passed) - energy increases, potty relief with probability, accident penalties, stat capping, boundary tests (exactly 80 vs >80), random_bool probability distribution (0.0, 0.8, 1.0)
**Suggested commit message:** "feat: add walk command with energy restoration and probabilistic potty management"

---

**Slice:** 07 ‚Äì Train Command
**Date:** 2025-10-12 17:30 Europe/UK
**Summary:** Implemented `termipet train` command to gain XP and level up while managing energy. Training increases XP by +20 and decreases energy by -15 (min 0). When XP reaches or exceeds 100, pet levels up (level +1, XP resets with rollover, happiness +5 bonus). Energy threshold check prevents training when energy <10 ("Kylo is too tired to train right now."). Handles multiple level-ups in single training session (e.g., XP 95‚Üí115 becomes Level 2 with XP 15). Two message variants: normal training ("üèãÔ∏è Kylo trains hard and gains experience!") or level up ("üèÜ Kylo levelled up to Level 2!"). Gracefully handles missing pet with placeholder detection. Changes are persisted automatically to pet.json.
**Tests:** All green (58/58 passed, run with --test-threads=1) - XP gain and energy cost, single level-up, multiple level-ups in one session, too tired prevention, energy threshold boundaries (exactly 10 vs <10), missing pet handling, state persistence
**Suggested commit message:** "feat: add train command to gain XP and level up with energy management"

**Slice:** 08 ‚Äì Potty and Clean Commands
**Date:** 2025-10-12 18:00 Europe/UK
**Summary:** Implemented `termipet potty` and `termipet clean` commands to manage pet's hygiene and potty needs. Potty command resets potty_level to 0 and increases happiness by +5. If potty_level >80 before action, an accident occurs (cleanliness -30, happiness -15, displays "üí© Kylo had an accident!"). Clean command increases cleanliness by +40 (capped at 100) with different messages for normal cleaning ("üßº Kylo feels fresh and happy!") vs already spotless ("‚ú® Kylo is already spotless!"). Both commands follow existing patterns from walk/feed/play commands, use cap_stat() for boundary enforcement, handle missing pet gracefully, and persist changes automatically to pet.json. All stat changes displayed with color-coded output (green for increases, red for decreases).
**Tests:** All green (68/68 total, 10/10 for slice) - potty resets level and increases happiness, accident triggers at >80 threshold, cleanliness increases and caps at 100, boundary tests (exactly 80 vs 81), missing pet handling
**Suggested commit message:** "feat: add potty and clean commands for hygiene management"

**Slice:** 09 ‚Äì Reset Command
**Date:** 2025-10-12 18:30 Europe/UK
**Summary:** Implemented `termipet reset` command to safely delete pet data and start fresh. Command prompts user for confirmation with "Are you sure you want to reset your pet? (y/n)" before deletion. If confirmed (y), deletes `~/.termipet/pet.json` and displays personalized message "üêæ {pet_name} has been released. You can adopt a new pet anytime." If declined (n), prints "Reset cancelled." and exits without changes. Handles missing pet file gracefully with "No pet found to reset." message. Re-prompts on invalid input (not y/n) with "Please type y or n." until valid response received. Implemented separate `confirm_reset()` helper function for testable confirmation logic. Made `get_pet_file_path()` public in persistence module to enable file existence checks.
**Tests:** All green (72/72 total, 4/4 for slice) - confirms and deletes file, cancels without confirmation, handles invalid input validation, detects missing file gracefully
**Suggested commit message:** "feat: add reset command to safely delete pet data and start fresh"

**Slice:** 10 ‚Äì Interactive Shell
**Date:** 2025-10-12 19:00 Europe/UK
**Summary:** Implemented `termipet shell` command to enter an interactive REPL-style session where users can issue pet care commands continuously without retyping the binary name. Shell displays colored prompt "üêæ termiPet>" and accepts all commands using slash syntax (`/feed`, `/play`, `/walk`, `/train`, `/status`, `/clean`, `/potty`, `/reset`). Special commands include `/help` (displays command list with descriptions) and `/exit` (exits gracefully). Command dispatcher reuses all existing command logic with zero duplication. Input is normalized (trimmed, lowercased) to handle variations like "  /FEED  ". Invalid commands display "Unknown command: '...' Type /help for options." Shell handles missing pet gracefully (stays active, shows error per command). Supports EOF (Ctrl+D) as alternative exit. Welcome message displays on entry with usage instructions. All stat changes and mood feedback work identically to standalone commands.
**Tests:** All green (79/79 total, 7/7 for slice) - command parsing for feed/exit/invalid/help, input normalization with whitespace and mixed case, empty input handling, execute_command return bool for exit signaling
**Suggested commit message:** "feat: add interactive shell command for continuous pet care"
