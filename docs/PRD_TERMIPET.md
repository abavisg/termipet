üêæ Product Requirements Document ‚Äî termiPet (MVP)

‚∏ª

1. Overview

Product Name: termiPet
Tagline: A virtual pet that lives in your terminal.
Product Type: Command-line application (Rust)
Status: MVP (Toy-first phase)

Summary

termiPet is a playful, terminal-native virtual pet that lives alongside developers in their CLI environment.
Users adopt and care for a digital companion that reacts to their actions (feed, play, walk, train, etc.), tracks its mood and stats, and persists across sessions.
The MVP focuses on fun and emotional engagement; a future expansion pack will add productivity features like streak tracking and break reminders.

2. Goals & Objectives

Goal	Description
üéÆ Engagement	Make terminal use more fun and personal.
üíæ Persistence	Ensure pet state is saved locally and survives restarts.
üß† Learning	Encourage playful experimentation with CLI commands.
üß© Expandability	Lay the groundwork for later productivity integration.

3. Target Users

Segment	Motivation
Everyday Developers	Add warmth and fun to their CLI routine.
Indie Hackers & Learners	Build consistency through playful feedback.
Students / Hobbyists	Learn basic CLI interaction via a friendly game.

4. Product Scope (MVP)

In Scope
	‚Ä¢	CLI interface via termipet <command>
	‚Ä¢	Persistent JSON storage in ~/.termipet/pet.json
	‚Ä¢	Pet model with core stats (hunger, happiness, energy, xp, level, cleanliness, potty_level)
	‚Ä¢	Eight main actions (see section 5)
	‚Ä¢	Moods and ASCII/emoji feedback
	‚Ä¢	Full test coverage for each action

Out of Scope (MVP)
	‚Ä¢	AI chat or natural language interaction
	‚Ä¢	Online features or cloud sync
	‚Ä¢	Productivity integrations (to be added in Expansion Pack)

5. Core Features & Behaviours

Command	Purpose	Core Behaviour
adopt	Create a pet	Set name/species, persist to file
status	View stats	Show hunger, happiness, energy, XP, level, cleanliness, potty
feed	Reduce hunger	hunger +20 (‚â§100), happiness +10
play	Increase happiness	happiness +15, energy ‚àí10
walk	Boost energy & relieve potty	energy +15, potty ‚àí50 (80 % chance)
train	Add XP, consume energy	xp +20, energy ‚àí15, auto-level at 100 XP
potty	Pet relieves itself	potty = 0, happiness +5
clean	Restore cleanliness	cleanliness +40, happiness +10
reset	Delete pet	Confirm and remove JSON file

Derived / Background Behaviours
	‚Ä¢	Idle decay: hunger ‚àí10 /day, happiness ‚àí5 /day, energy +5 /day, potty +5 /day
	‚Ä¢	Mood engine: updates after each command
	‚Ä¢	Accidents: potty > 80 ‚Üí cleanliness ‚àí30, happiness ‚àí15

6. Technical Overview

Layer	Detail
Language	Rust (stable)
CLI Framework	clap
Persistence	serde + serde_json, stored in ~/.termipet/pet.json
Terminal Output	colored for mood/state colour cues
Directory Handling	dirs crate for OS-agnostic home paths
Testing	Rust built-in test framework (unit + integration)
Architecture	Modular ‚Äî models/, commands/, storage/, main.rs
Data Model	Pet struct: name, species, hunger, happiness, energy, xp, level, cleanliness, potty_level

7. User Stories (MVP)
	1.	Adopt a pet:
As a new user, I want to create and name my pet so I can start interacting with it.
	2.	Feed and play:
As a user, I want to feed and play with my pet so it stays happy.
	3.	Check status:
As a user, I want to see my pet‚Äôs current mood and stats.
	4.	Persistence:
As a user, I want my pet‚Äôs progress saved automatically between sessions.
	5.	Handle accidents:
As a user, I want to clean up when my pet has an accident.
	6.	Reset:
As a user, I can start over by deleting my current pet.

8. Success Metrics

Metric	Target
Time-to-delight	First happy reaction within 60 seconds of adoption
Daily engagement	‚â• 3 commands executed per active session
7-day retention	‚â• 40 % of users interact again within a week
Reliability	0 data loss across restarts


‚∏ª

9. Risks & Mitigations

Risk	Mitigation
Data loss due to file corruption	Auto-recreate JSON on load failure
User loses interest quickly	Humour, randomised messages, evolving moods
CLI incompatibility	Use dirs + cross-platform crates
Scope creep	Stick to defined slices (01‚Äì09) for MVP


‚∏ª

10. Phasing & Slices

Phase	Deliverable	Description
Slice 01	Persistence Layer	Save/load JSON
Slice 02	Adopt	Create and persist pet
Slice 03	Status	Display stats/mood
Slice 04	Feed	Adjust hunger/happiness
Slice 05	Play	Adjust happiness/energy
Slice 06	Walk	Energy + potty relief
Slice 07	Train	XP + level-up logic
Slice 08	Potty & Clean	Accidents + cleanup
Slice 09	Reset	Restart fresh pet
Slice 10 (optional)	Interactive Shell	/feed style REPL loop
